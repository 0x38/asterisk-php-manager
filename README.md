[Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) is an open source [PBX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_branch_exchange#Private_branch_exchange) which provides a manager interface for sending text-based commands to in order to execute commands on the server. Examples include:

* Adding handset to a queue.
* Monitoring a channel.
* Originating a call.
* Getting server status.
* Closing channels.

This was originally developed to help integrate PHP-driven CRM systems in the lending industry into the Asterisk PBX.
