Asterisk PHP Manager
====================

The [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) Manager PHP API enables a developer to control their Asterisk PBX system from a PHP application.  Allowing for call origination, monitoring, queue management, etc. Other examples include:

* Adding handset to a queue.
* Monitoring a channel.
* Originating a call.
* Getting server status.
* Closing channels.

This was originally developed to help integrate PHP-driven CRM systems in the lending industry into the Asterisk PBX.
